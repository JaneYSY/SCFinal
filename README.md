# COVID-19 Simulation

Software Carpentary Final Project
Team: Zhezhi Chen, Shengyu Yao

## Background
We are all stuck at home due to COVID-19. Disease tranmitting is terrifying enough. 
Cruise ships, due to the nature of being a close, isolated environment with highly concentrated populations of 
widespread backgrounds and active social interaction, become one of the highest places of confirmed cases per capita.

This project is to demonstrate how COVID-19 (or any contagious disease) spreads in a closed environment, such as a cruise. 
1000 people are placed in the environment. 25 randomly-selected patient zeros are randomly placed at different locations on the floor plan of an x-y plot.
We simulate how the disease passes from one to the other, showing it on GUI.
Actions, such as isolating patients, restricting the travel of individuals, or reducing transmission probabilities(like wearing masks) are taken to prevent the spreading. Those actions are manageable. By playing with the actions, players can see if they are able to control the disease.
